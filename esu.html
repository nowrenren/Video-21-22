			<p>With a strong drive to take on new challenges, Esu has a lively personality, always full of energy. He's always restless, moving and talking non-stop, <span>but he loves adventures and is in many ways, versatile.</span> He's over the moon to be participating in the reality competition show "4piece" after getting scouted by Nice.</p>

			<p>Esu is a boy of below average height with dark blue hair with a singular light blue streak and underdye in the style of a messy bob. He has light purple eyes and long lashes. He wears a black turtleneck under a printed white t-shirt with a blue and green logo, a large multicolored jacket, and black shorts. His t-shirt has a diagonal silver zipper near the left sleeve. He wears white socks with a checkered pattern and a red rim around the top along with a pair of chunky white sneakers. I'm Esu Sagiri, the man who will stand at the top of the idol industry one day! Adventure itself is what life's all about, and you can go just about anywhere with that in mind! Any failure still makes for a good experience! If anything, not taking the first step is the biggest failure of all! So that’s why I'll challenge it all—the audition and whatever else coming my way! Aiming to represent idols worldwide! With huge dreams kept close to my heart—now let the adventure begin!!!!</p>
